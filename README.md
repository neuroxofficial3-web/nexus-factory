# 🚀 Nexus AI Factory

An automated mobile application development engine powered by **16 AI Agents** and **GitHub Actions**. This system transforms high-level ideas into fully functional Android APKs through a multi-layered autonomous pipeline.

## 🏗 System Architecture
The factory utilizes a hierarchical agent orchestration model to ensure production-grade output:

1.  **Phase 1: Architecture (5 Agent Cluster)** - Senior Architects design a fail-proof technical logic and system blueprint based on the user's idea.
2.  **Phase 2: Development (5 Agent Cluster)** - Lead Developers convert the blueprint into modular Python/Kivy code.
3.  **Phase 3: QA & Self-Healing (6 Agent Cluster)** - QA Engineers cross-reference the code with the blueprint, identify logic gaps, and auto-fix bugs.
4.  **Phase 4: DevOps & CI/CD** - Automatic generation of `requirements.txt` and cloud compilation into an Android APK via GitHub Actions.



## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Engine:** Python 3.9+
- **AI Brain:** Llama 3.3-70B (via Groq API)
- **UI Framework:** Kivy / KivyMD
- **Automation:** GitHub Actions & Buildozer

## 🚀 How It Works (Pipeline)


- **Push to Main:** Triggers the 16-agent AI cluster.
- **Audit Report:** Generates a detailed audit of changes and logic fixes.
- **Auto-Config:** Automatically injects dependencies into `buildozer.spec`.
- **APK Deployment:** Compiles and provides a downloadable Android APK.

## 📱 Current Project Focus
- **Active Build:** Professional AI Finance Manager with Voice Commands
- **Lead Developer:** Mufadul Ajlan
